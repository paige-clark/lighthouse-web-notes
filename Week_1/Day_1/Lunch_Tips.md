## Notes

Broke the problem in to smaller pieces to solve it efficiently. Breaking problems down before trying to code the answer helps make smarter decisions when coding.

```javascript
/* NOTES
1. Intake boolean value of hungry being true or false.
2. Intake inputted available time.
3. If hungry = false return message.
4. If hungry = true and time is less than 20 min return message.
5. If hungry = true and time is between 20min and 30min return message.
6. If hungry = true and time is over 30min return message.
7. Return a message if the inputs are messed up.

```

Experimented with comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `===`) in the node REPL.
